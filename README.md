## Introduction
We believe in open source applications and the possibility to reproduce scientific results by full disclosure of code and methods. Therefore we published all source code used in context of this dissertation in this repository. This repository contains additional code and libraries, which we used for the data analysis in this dissertation (e.g., the simulation and fitting library for the Hawkes process).

*Note that his repository contains the additional code and libraries only.*
